# GameOfgames
This program is collection of 5 games played to determine the one of the entire game of games.

This game was created by: Eduardo, Sarah, Pranick, and Lincoln

This game includes: 
3 files for 3 versions of the game
   1. Player mode
   2. Test mode
   3. Bug mode

The Player mode us used to provide the player experience--it is what you should use if you want to play the games smoothly (without cheeting or bugs). 

The Test mode displays information that allows the user to cheat by seeing information in advance of ur during game play. This mode allows the program to be tested without playing it over and over until the program randomly displays the behavior to be tested. 

The Bug mode, like the test mode, displays the information that will allow the user to cheat for testing purposes. However, it is also has 3 bugs seeded into the code. If you want to play through the games smoothly, this is not the best option. But once you get familar with the games, you could try running this mode of the program to figure out what the bugs are.

Each of these modes holds a different version of the Game of Games. The Game of Games is a game that runs 5 different mini-games within it. You start the Game of Games and then get to choose which smaller games you want to play, eventually when you want to stop playing you wil be prompted to quit the program, and the scoreboard for the overall points you won and the computer won will be displayed. Enjoy! 

The files in this folder represent all the games: 

The mini-games are: 
- CoinFlip
- EvenOrOdd
- FindRedThread
- FindTheThimble
- GetInput
- GuessTheNumber
